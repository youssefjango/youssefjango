My interest in video games was very early in my life. I was born in Morocco, and my parents brought me to a game center. So, I started playing video games from a very early age, from open-world games like Minecraft to web flash games. However, it was once, when I was playing Sonic Generations at 7, that I thought: how is it made? Is it in a conditional video? Or even conditional images? That's when my journey towards programming and game development started. Even though some think it's more difficult, my favorite types of games( both on the dev side and the play side) are 3D games with a lot of interactive tools. For this summer, I aim to find an internship in a software-related field, but it would be a dream to work for a game company :)

To sum it up,
- I'm currently studying Software Engineering.
- I'm currently working on Game Development, low-level programming, and network programming.
- I'm looking for more help to break into the gaming industry.
